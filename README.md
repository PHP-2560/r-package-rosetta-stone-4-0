Our package will be an extension of our final in class on webscrapeing pubmed.   Loading the package should allow the user to webscrape by keyword with just a function, and create output like our previous in class with functions.   Our main focus will be on pulling keywords and citations (things not readily availible in the existing package we'll be using).  Our team structure will be relitively flat with each member involved in most parts of the project.  However the general responsibilities will be as follows:

Kira will be primiraly be involved in webscraping
Frank will be primiraly be involved in text mining and code involving the Rentrez
Blake will be primiraly be involved in orginization of data involving citations, which needs to be pulled seperatly and joined with the other data
Nadia will be primiraly involved in making the data output to knit organized, as well as creating the graphs our package will product

Our bare minimum goal is the replication of what was done before as a package.  Pulling the top ten keywords based upon a user given search over the last ten years.   We will then work on grabing and outputting citations for specific papers.  Goals beyond that will be concived and worked on time permitting.
